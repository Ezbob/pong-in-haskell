# PONG IN HASKELL

This is simply a pong clone written in the pure functional programming language; Haskell.
Special thanks to goes to Andrew Gibiansky for his blog entry on programming a pong game in Haskell:
[Your First Haskell Application (with Gloss)](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-gloss/)

## How to run it
The Cabal package manager tool is needed for compiling/running this game. Once this is in place simply type:
```
cabal run
```
In the project root folder.
